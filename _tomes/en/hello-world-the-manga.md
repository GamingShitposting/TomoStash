An atmospheric high school love story with a science fiction plot full of twists and turns. (And don’t miss the light novel, also from Seven Seas!)

Naomi is a shy teenage boy living an ordinary life until the day a mysterious man appears–himself, ten years in the future. Future Naomi brings a dire warning: Naomi’s soon-to-be girlfriend Ruri will be in a tragic accident not long after they start dating. Can they change the past and build a better future…or is there something more to Naomi’s mission than saving one girl’s life?
