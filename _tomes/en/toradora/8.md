THE TRIP OF A LIFETIME

A new school term begins as Ryuuji, still hurting from Minori’s rejection, awkwardly tries to figure out how to face her. Meanwhile, something weird’s going on between Taiga and Kitamura—and with everyone packed into close quarters for a school trip to the mountains, hidden motives start rising to the surface.
