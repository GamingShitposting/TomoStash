OH, WHAT A TANGLED WEB!

As their second year of high school draws to a close, Ryuuji wrestles with college plans, money troubles, and his secret discovery of Taiga’s feelings for him. Minori and Ami’s feud reaches a tipping point, and the return of Taiga’s mother threatens everything. Can they all sort out their tangled feelings before it’s too late—and will their friendships survive it, if they do?!
