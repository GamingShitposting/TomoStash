<p>Twenty-something-year-old Satou, a college dropout and aficionado of anime porn, knows a little secret--or at least he thinks he does! Believe it or not, he has stumbled upon an incredible conspiracy created by the Japanese Broadcasting Company NHK. But despite fighting the good fight, Satou has become an unemployed Hikikomori--a shut-in who as withdrawn from the world...</p> <p>One day, he meets Misaki, a mysterious young girl who invites him to join her special "project". Slowly Satou comes out of his reclusive shell, and his hilarious journey begins: filled with mistaken identity; panty shots; Lolita complexes--and an ultimate quest to create the greatest hentai game ever!</p> -- VIZ Media
