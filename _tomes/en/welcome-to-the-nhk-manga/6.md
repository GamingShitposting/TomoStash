<p>Satou's hallucinations of an Angel-Misaki are getting worse! Having run away from home, he now turns to arcades and pachinko bars for relief. But he soon learns that these are expensive habits, and that his escapism comes at a cost he might not be willing to pay. Feeling alone, with no one to turn to, especially now that Yamazaki's got his own girl problems, Satou is at an all-time low. Where will he turn? Fates are intertwined and secrets revealed in this, the next volume of Welcome to the N.H.K.!</p> -- VIZ Media
