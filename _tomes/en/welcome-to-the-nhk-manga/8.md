<p>Satou vowed to fight the evil organization known as N.H.K. and save the future from eroticism, violence, and drugs. Instead, he has become a delusional shut-in and lost the only girl that ever offered him love. Surely, this is rock bottom.</p> <p>But from the bottom there's nowhere to go but up...and higher. So Yamazaki plants a garden of illegal herbs to inspire a revolutionary otaku uprising. Will it be enough to return Misaki to Satou or Satou to the real world? Can any plot save Mita House and its hikikomori inhabitants?</p> -- VIZ Media
